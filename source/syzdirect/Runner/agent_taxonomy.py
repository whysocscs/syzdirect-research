KERNEL_TARGET_STRUCTURE_TAXONOMY = """KERNEL TARGET STRUCTURE TAXONOMY

Do not assume a kernel target is solved by choosing one syscall.
Classify the target as a combination of these layers:

1. syscall family:
   sendmsg / setsockopt / ioctl / bpf / socket / fs / mm / packet / netlink

2. resource chain:
   producer-consumer sequence such as socket -> bind -> sendmsg,
   open -> ioctl, bpf map -> bpf prog, table -> chain -> rule

3. payload grammar:
   scalar, pointer struct, ioctl command struct, setsockopt opt struct,
   msghdr/iovec, netlink nested attrs, packet frame, BPF bytecode

4. subsystem state:
   TC qdisc/filter, nft table/chain/rule transaction, xfrm state/policy,
   socket lifecycle, BPF map/prog/verifier, filesystem namespace

5. dispatch selector:
   TCA_KIND, nft message type, XFRM_MSG_*, ioctl cmd, optname,
   proto_ops, Qdisc_ops, tcf_proto_ops, nfnetlink, genl family

6. blocking layer:
   If dist is large, suspect wrong syscall family or dispatch selector.
   If dist is small, suspect exact payload attrs, branch condition, or missing state.

Before generating any seed:
- classify the layers above
- choose exactly one blocking layer
- generate only seeds that attack that layer
- preserve existing working resource/state setup
